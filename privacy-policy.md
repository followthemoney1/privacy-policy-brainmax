Privacy Policy for Brain MAX

Effective Date: August 18, 2025

Welcome to Brain MAX. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.

By using Brain MAX, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect

To provide and improve our service, we collect the following types of information:

User-Provided Information: This includes any text, prompts, system messages, and files (such as images, documents, or PDFs) that you voluntarily input or upload into the application.

Locally Stored Data: Your conversation history and saved prompts are stored directly and securely on your device. We do not have access to this information unless you choose to share it with us for support purposes.

Usage Data (Non-Personal): We may collect anonymous data about your interaction with the app, such as which features are used most often and crash reports. This helps us understand how to improve the user experience. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.

2. How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used for the following purposes:

To Provide and Maintain the Service: Your inputs, such as prompts and attached files, are sent directly to the third-party AI model you select (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) to generate a response. We act as an intermediary and do not permanently store this content on our servers.

To Improve the Application: We use anonymous usage data to identify bugs, enhance performance, and develop new features.

For Customer Support: If you contact us for support, we may need to access information you provide to resolve your issue.

3. How Information is Shared

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others. Your data is shared only in the following limited circumstances:

With Third-Party AI Providers: When you submit a prompt or a file, that specific data is sent to the AI service you have selected to process your request and generate a response. We recommend you review the privacy policies of the individual AI providers you choose to use within Brain MAX.

For Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

4. Data Storage and Security

The security of your data is a top priority.

Local Storage: Your chat history and saved prompts are stored locally on your device. This gives you full control over your data. If you uninstall the app, this data will be deleted.

Security Measures: We use industry-standard security measures to protect the anonymous usage data we collect and to ensure the secure transmission of your prompts to third-party AI providers. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

5. Your Rights and Choices

You have full control over the data you create within Brain MAX. You can:

Access and Edit: Access your conversation history and saved prompts at any time within the app.

Delete: Delete individual messages, entire conversations, or saved prompts directly from your device through the app's interface.

6. Children's Privacy

Our service is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
