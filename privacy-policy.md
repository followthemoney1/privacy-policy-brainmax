Local Data: Your chat history and saved prompts stay on your device, safe and sound. We don’t peek unless you share for support.

AI Providers: Your prompts/files go to the AI service you choose to get answers. Check their privacy policies too.
Legal Stuff: If the law or authorities ask, we might have to share some info.

4. Data Storage & Security
Your data’s safe with us:

Local Storage: Chats and prompts live on your device. Delete the app, and poof, it’s gone.
